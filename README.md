üåü TaskMaster

**TaskMaster** is a task management mobile app created as part of the Mobile Application Development course at **SLIIT**. This application showcases the integration of essential Android development tools and libraries such as **Room Database**, **Kotlin Coroutines**, **ViewModel**, and **RecyclerView**.

The goal of TaskMaster is to offer a user-friendly platform to handle day-to-day tasks effectively. It allows users to seamlessly **create, update, delete**, and **view** their tasks. The use of Kotlin Coroutines ensures smooth background operations, while the Room persistence library manages local data storage efficiently.
